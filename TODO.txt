Steps:
------

- Compile parsed template into executable template (which includes any dependencies such as functions that it needs)
	- Also validate variables references and function calls (function exits and valid parameters passed)
- When the compiled template is run, the model that is passed is auto inspected and all property values are put into a template model
	- The template model has a collection of initialised variables that can be added to at "runtime" and only used after they have been defined
