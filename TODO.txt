TODO:
-----

- Indexers:
	- Refactor NettleRenderer.ResolveValue to handle index pointers
	- Handle {{@Truncate($Names[0], 3)}} by refactoring parameter parsing code to look for indexers
		- Currently get exception: "No property could be found with the name 'Names[0]'."

- Complete Wiki

- Flags:
	- Implement {{#DebugMode}}

- Create IStringifier interface and integrate into INettleResolver so we can get all formatters for different types (e.g. XmlDocument)

Extensions:
-----------

- Nettle.Data
	- Eventually things like Nettle.Data.Sql that could connect to MS SQL Server etc
	- N.b. with Nettle.Web provide functions to read through imported JSON data too (what if it's XML/Soap?).

	- Data.SQL
		- Registered connections (name, connection string, provider/db adapter)
		- Execute stored procedure with connection name, procedure name and parameter values. Get result as data grid.
		- Execute general SQL query with connection name and SQL query. Get results as data grid.
		- N.b. how do we ensure read only stored procedure and SQL queries are executed? I.e. ensure no db writes are made - to keep Nettle as a read/render only engine.
	
- Nettle.Web
	Functions.CallWebApi
	- Call a web api and get json result as JObject
	- Get specific value from JSON object function
	- How do we handle headers? (e.g. security like we use)

	Http post and delete? Anything else?

Low Priority:
-------------

- Some sort of "List all..." tag that can list all functions or variables or model fields etc (something like {{?@}} for all functions, {{?.}} for variables and {{?$}} for all model bindings
- Array indexer binding (e.g. Names[0] which would get the first item in the array Names)
- Consider support for if statement conditions that let you do things like number > 10 or number == 1 etc (that would be contained in brackets? like {{if (number > 10)}})
	- negation (i.e. if not true)
	- {{else}} and {{else if}} blocks
- Upgrade to .NET 4.7 and check how I can create back-wards compatible NuGet packages
- TemplateContext: lazy load properties on demand (i.e. only when first model binding is rendered, if there are any) to improve performance?
- Add support for caching
