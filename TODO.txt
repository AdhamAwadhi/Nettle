Bugs:

TODO:
-----
- Create separate projects for integrations with 3rd party tools like json.net, ncalc etc (would have separate nuget - like Autofac)
	- Create Nettle.Web project with dependencies like json.net etc which has functions for pulling and pushing http resources as well as specialised web api call functions that return json models.
- Create support for json and xml type models in terms of model bindings.
- Create some sort of IFunctionResolver that gets all functions for the assembly. Then Nettle can scan all assemblies for resolvers.

- Render partial template - not as function but a built in expression (e.g. {{> TemplateName Model}})

- Functions that can take any number of parameters (will effect validation) in the same way C# allows params
- Consider support for if statement conditions that let you do things like number > 10 or number == 1 etc (that would be contained in brackets? like {{if (number > 10)}})
- Get Chris to do some testing (using the demo and also create his own test project and integrate using NuGet)
- Create NuGet package for integration with Sabre etc

- Write unit tests:
	- Parser
	- Validator
	- Renderer
	- Full test using compiler


Function Ideas:
---------------

- Maths operations such as add, take away, divide and multiply
- Call Web API and get JSON result (that can then be used as model data)
	- Async methods so we can handle things like API call function?
	- How do we handle headers? (e.g. security like we use)
	- Get specific value from JSON object function
	- Generic template model to hold HTTP JSON result
- Math formula evaluator (use 3rd party tool)
