TODO:
-----

- If statement conditions
	- Look into "No '{{/if}}' tag was found." bug with nested if-else statements (see emailed example)
	- Update wiki to show support for else and else if statements

- Indexers:
	- Handle nested indexers (e.g. Rows[0].Values[1])

Low Priority:
-------------

- Create IStringifier interface and integrate into INettleResolver so we can get all formatters for different types (e.g. XmlDocument)

- Upgrade to .NET 4.7 and check how I can create back-wards compatible NuGet packages

- Add support for caching
