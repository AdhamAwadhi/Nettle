* Create static 'Engine' entry point for Nettle that allows default dependencies to be resolve or overridden with custom IActivator (useful for injecting more functions with a customer function repository)
* Create NuGet package for integration with Sabre etc

* Write unit tests and run!
	Unit tests:
	Parser
	Validator
	Renderer
	Full test using compiler

Function Ideas:
---------------

- Call Web API and get JSON result (that can then be used as model data)
	- Async methods so we can handle things like API call function?
	- How do we handle headers? (e.g. security like we use)
	- Get specific value from JSON object function
	- Generic template model to hold HTTP JSON result
- Render partial (with ability to pass custom model or inherit)
- Math formula evaluator (use 3rd party tool)
