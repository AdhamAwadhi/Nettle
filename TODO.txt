Bugs:

TODO:
-----
- Render partial template - not as function but a built in expression (e.g. {{> TemplateName Model}})
- Create separate projects for integrations with 3rd party tools like json.net, ncalc etc (would have separate nuget - like Autofac)
- Create NuGet package for integration with Sabre etc

- Write unit tests and run!
	- Parser
	- Validator
	- Renderer
	- Full test using compiler


Function Ideas:
---------------

- Call Web API and get JSON result (that can then be used as model data)
	- Async methods so we can handle things like API call function?
	- How do we handle headers? (e.g. security like we use)
	- Get specific value from JSON object function
	- Generic template model to hold HTTP JSON result
- Math formula evaluator (use 3rd party tool)
